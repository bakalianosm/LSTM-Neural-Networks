### A Deep Learning project that I implemented for *Software Development for Algorithmic Problems* course.

## Project Description
This is a Deep Learning project that uses Keras API. Forecast and Anomaly Detection projects implemented using LSTM Neural Networks after a lot of experiments for choosing hyperparameters.

This repository contains a project that it has 2 submodules that use mainly **LSTM** Neural Networks:
1. Prediction of Stock Prices
2. Stock Price Anomaly Detection
