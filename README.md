### A Deep Learning project that I implemented for *Software Development for Algorithmic Problems* course.

## Project Description
This is a Deep Learning project that uses **Keras API** . Forecast and Anomaly Detection projects implemented using LSTM Neural Networks after a lot of experiments for choosing hyperparameters.

## Forecasting
First the user has to specify the arguments of this program in order to work properly. 
To run the forecast program try:
΄python3 forecast.py -d [dataset_name] -n [n_time_series] ΄
## Anomaly Detection
